# social-network

## Description
The goal of this challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

With the use of Insomnia, show how someone can add/edit/remove a user, search for a user, add or remove a reaction, add or remove a friend, and add or delete a thought (similar to a post on other social networks).

## Usage
To use this API, open Insomnia or Postman and create different collections for Users, Reactions, Thoughts, and Friends. As I complete this project, the walkthrough video will showcase the different API calls to make.
